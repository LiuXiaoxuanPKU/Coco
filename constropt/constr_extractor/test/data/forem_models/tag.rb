# We allow content creators to "tag" their content.  This model helps
# define what we mean when we "tag" something.

# These tags can be arbitrary or supported (e.g. `tag.supported ==

# :sponsorship`).  Some tags have moderators.  These tags can create a

#
# Sometimes we need to consolidate tags (e.g. rubyonrails and rails).
# In this case, we mark one of those tags as an alias for the other
# (via `alias_for`).  The direct tags is the "preferred" tag
# (e.g. not the alias).

  # @param follower [#id, #class_name] An object who's class "acts_as_follower" (e.g. a User).
  #
  # @return [ActiveRecord::Relation<Tag>] with the "points" attribute and limited field selection
  #         for presenting followed tags on the front-end.
  #
  # @note This method will also add the follower's "points" for the given tag.  In the
  #       ActiveRecord::Base implementation, we can add "virtual" attributes by including them in
  #       the select statement (as shown in the method implementation).  Doing this can sometimes
  #       result in a surprise, so you may want to consider casting the results into a well-defined
  #       data structure.  But then you might be looking at implementing the DataMapper pattern.
  #
  #
  # @example
  #   Below is the SQL generated:
  #
  #   ```sql
  #     SELECT tags.*, "followings"."points"
  #       FROM "tags"
  #         INNER JOIN "follows" "followings"
  #           ON "followings"."followable_type" = 'ActsAsTaggableOn::Tag'
  #           AND "followings"."followable_id" = "tags"."id"
  #       WHERE "followings"."follower_id" = 1
  #          AND "followings"."follower_type" = 'User'
  #     ORDER BY "tags"."hotness_score" DESC
  #   ```
  #
  # @see Tag#points
  #
  # @see UserDecorator::CACHED_TAGGED_BY_USER_ATTRIBUTES for discussion on why we're selecting this.
  #
  # @todo should we sort by hotness score?  Wouldn't the user's points make more sense?
