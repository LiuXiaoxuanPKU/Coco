module IncidentManagement
  # Shared functionality for a `#status` field, representing
  # whether action is required. In EE, this corresponds
  # to paging functionality with EscalationPolicies.
  #
  # This module is only responsible for setting the status and
  # possible status-related timestamps (EX triggered_at/resolved_at)
  # for the implementing class. The relationships between these
  # values and other related timestamps/logic should be managed from
  # the object class itself. (EX Alert#ended_at = Alert#resolved_at)
