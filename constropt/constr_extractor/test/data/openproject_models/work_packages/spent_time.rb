module WorkPackages::SpentTime
  # Returns the total number of hours spent on this work package and its descendants.
  # The result can be a subset of the actual spent time in cases where the user's permissions
  # are limited, i.e. he lacks the view_time_entries and/or view_work_packages permission.
  #
  # Example:
  #   spent_hours => 0.0
  #   spent_hours => 50.2
  #
  #   The value can stem from either eager loading the value via
  #   WorkPackage.include_spent_time in which case the work package has an
  #   #hours attribute or it is loaded on calling the method.
