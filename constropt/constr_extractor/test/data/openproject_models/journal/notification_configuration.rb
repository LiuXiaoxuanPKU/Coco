class Journal::NotificationConfiguration
  class << self
    # Allows controlling whether notifications are sent out for created journals.
    # After the block is executed, the setting is returned to its original state which is true by default.
    # In case the method is called multiple times within itself, the first setting prevails.
    # This allows to control the setting globally without having to pass the setting down the call stack in
    # order to ensure all subsequent code follows the provided setting.
