# frozen_string_literal: true

# An InternalId is a strictly monotone sequence of integers
# generated for a given scope and usage.
#
# The monotone sequence may be broken if an ID is explicitly provided
# to `.track_greatest_and_save!` or `#track_greatest`.
#
# For example, issues use their project to scope internal ids:
# In that sense, scope is "project" and usage is "issues".
# Generated internal ids for an issue are unique per project.
#
# See InternalId#usage enum for available usages.
#
# In order to leverage InternalId for other usages, the idea is to
# * Add `usage` value to enum
# * (Optionally) add columns to `internal_ids` if needed for scope.
