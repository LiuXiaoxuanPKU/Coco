    # This is the one true way to create a Version.
    #
    # This method means you can avoid the paradox of versions being invalid without
    # designs, and not being able to add designs without a saved version. Also this
    # method inserts designs in bulk, rather than one by one.
    #
    # Before calling this method, callers must guard against concurrent
    # modification by obtaining the lock on the design repository. See:
    # `DesignManagement::Version.with_lock`.
    #
    # Parameters:
    # - design_actions [DesignManagement::DesignAction]:
    #     the actions that have been performed in the repository.
    # - sha [String]:
    #     the SHA of the commit that performed them
    # - author [User]:
    #     the user who performed the commit
    # returns [DesignManagement::Version]
