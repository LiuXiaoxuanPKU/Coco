# == Featurable concern
#
# This concern adds features (tools) functionality to Project and Group
# To enable features you need to call `set_available_features`
#
# Example:
#
# class ProjectFeature
#   include Featurable
#   set_available_features %i(wiki merge_request)

  # Permission levels:
  #
  # Disabled: not enabled for anyone
  # Private:  enabled only for team members
  # Enabled:  enabled for everyone able to access the project
  # Public:   enabled for everyone (only allowed for pages)
